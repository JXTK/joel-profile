            Hi! I am Joel, currently a high school freshman at DPS Pune. I am a
            front-end web developer and learning backend. I have no work experience
            as of yet, but am looking forward to intern. I am also a pythonista, and
            have worked on data visualization. Apart from this, I am also an
            AI/ML enthusiast and make custom Discord bots.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            My hobbies include listening to music, gaming and swimming. I like
            watching movies, at least once a month. I play basketball on
            weekends and chess whenever I get time. I’m into reading thriller
            and crime novels as well. I also love watching anime and reading manga.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            If you want a custom discord bot or a portfolio website or just in general 
            get in touch with me, then you can contact me by email, discord or any other
            social link below, and I'll be happy to help!
          </p> </font>

          <!--- NEXT STEPS: Easy, responsive YouTube/iframe embeds? We've got a helper for that:
          <div class="video-wrapper__16-9">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSP0b85BKmY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
