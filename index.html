            Hi! I am Joel, currently a high-school student at DPS Pune. I am a
            front-end web developer and learning backend. I have worked in
            Execute Big as an intern for 5 months. I am also a pythonista, and have
            worked on data visualization. Apart from this, I am also an AI/ML enthusiast
            and make custom Discord bots. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            My hobbies include listening to music, gaming and swimming.  
          </p>

          <!--- NEXT STEPS: Easy, responsive YouTube/iframe embeds? We've got a helper for that:
          <div class="video-wrapper__16-9">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSP0b85BKmY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>
          --->

          {{> links }}
        </div>
      </div>

      <!--- FOOTER: You can safely remove the Glitch footer (but tell your friends!) âœ‚ --->
      {{> glitch-footer }}
    </main>
  </body>
